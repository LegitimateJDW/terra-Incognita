## John Worley's Terra Incognita

The (Soon to be) longest original work of fiction in human history, hosted right here, on a page i have no real idea how to create, funnily enough. You'd think i'd put more foresight into this, but here we are.  

Regardless, I Personally thank every single person who visits this site, and gives my life's work a read. It means the world to me, and I am trully greatful.
